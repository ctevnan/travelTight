Hotel Reviews

Bad 1 star review
Miserable! Worst hotel ever. Restaurant: food beyond compare, food beyond belief. Unreasonable charges: Added 2% for looking in the mirror twice & 3% for sleeping with the window shut.

Name: Good Hotel
Description: This hotel isn't just good for tourists; it's good for the environment, too. The mismatch, colorful furnishings are almost exclusively made from reclaimed and recycled materials, and the hotel's mantra is "Renew, Reuse, Relax." It hopes to inspire and excite its guests to “be good” to the environment, providing a chalkboard wall for feedback instead of note cards, and complimentary bikes for exploring the city. Buzzy nightlife and edgy galleries and shops are just outside, thanks to Good Hotel's trendy SoMa location.
