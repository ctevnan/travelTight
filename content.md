Hotel Reviews

Bad 1 star review
Miserable! Worst hotel ever. Restaurant: food beyond compare, food beyond belief. Unreasonable charges: Added 2% for looking in the mirror twice & 3% for sleeping with the window shut.

The mismatch, colorful furnishings are almost exclusively made from reclaimed and recycled materials, and the hotel's mantra is "Renew, Reuse, Relax." It hopes to inspire and excite its guests to “be good” to the environment, providing a chalkboard wall for feedback instead of note cards, and complimentary bikes for exploring the city.

Nice hotel, reasonable room. Location could be better.

5 stars
The location is borderline; 3 blocks North is a business district, but near the hotel you'll find drunks sleeping on the sidewalk. Welcome to San Fran
One of four co-owned hotels adjacent to each other. The Good Hotel is nice, and offers use of the decent gym, outdoor pool and rooftop sun deck at the co-owned hotel across the street. The staff is friendly, the wifi is strong. Note that there is an extra charge for parking, if you use it.

3 stars
You get what you can expect for the price. Though the rooms could be better. Ok for a short stay.

4 stars
This hotel is worth the price. It's about 1/2 of other hotels, and while you get what you pay for, it's really a great deal. There is no AC (rarely needed in SF anyway) and some urban street noise, but the rooms are clean, it's right at Civic Center and a block from BART. And the staff is really great! Definitely worth it.

I stayed here for a week. Location is a huge plus, I went to SF for a convention and walking to the Moscone Center took less than 10 minutes. I was expecting an awesome room because of the pics they have online but my room was meh, no art in the walls; aside that, the room was pretty nice, the bed was comfortable, I had a mini fridge and the shower worked great. I read in a lot of reviews that people hated rooms that faced the back alley because they pick up the garbage at around 3 am and there's a lot of noise, the guy at the front desk offered me some earplugs when I checked in but I never had to use them, I didn't hear a thing. And the price was pretty great for the kind of hotel and the location.

4 stars
What you pay for  (and this place is pretty affordable) is a place to hang your hat and catch some z's. Its also steps away from Chinatown, and not that far from the Bart. The staff were also super friendly to me. They were super helpful with directions and stuff to see. Summing up, don't stay here if you expect a luxury hotel. Then again, you're in SF. What are you doing hanging out in a hotel all day?

1 star
The location is comfortable, the rooms are cozy and the decor is quirky and quaint. Yet I will never go back here. Because of the service! Some of the rudest service I have experienced in the US. 

5 stars
Great location, friendly staff, nice rooms!

This elegant hotel provided great service at all times. Room service came quickly and breakfast was pretty good. Restaurant service/food was adequate though not above average hotel grade food for a hotel of this category. Nice, clean fitness facility, everything in good working order.

5 stars
The Fairmont is San Fran historical charm at it's best. If you got the cash, this place is where you'll want to stay when you're in the area. The place is very plush & very classy.

5 stars
We stayed at the Fairmont for a business trip and had a room on the 5th floor of the old building. The lobby itself is worth a trip --- grand and beautiful. Our room overlooked a beautiful garden with a fountain in its center, and the views we had of the city and the water were beautiful. 

5 stars
Stayed here for the first time, unfortunately for only a one night stay. Very impressed with the decor, ambiance, grandeur, and history associated with the hotel.

Really good hotel if you're planning to visit the city all day long and need a place to stay in for cheap. We read reviews and were expecting a dirty hotel but honetly it was clean and the showers and toilet were always in perfect state. It is near a lot of bus stops so easy to travel around the city. 

3 stars
San Francisco is an expensive city and I was concerned I would not be able to find a hotel that would meet all my needs which would include a good location, good amenities, cleanliness and a budget price. Well, Hotel North Beach met my needs.

4 stars
We were nervous about staying after seeing all the negative reviews, however we found the place to be exactly what we needed. China town is one block over and the Italian district is just up the road. Fishermans Wharf and Coit tower are easily walkable, we only used a bus once to get out to Golden Gate Park. 

3 stars
It's near everything you need to see in SF. Letting aside the poor service at check in and for our entire stay, we had a good stay. Rooms are small but that's normal. They don't have air conditioning and windows are the only options to get a bit of air.

I loved this hotel.  It was cute, the staff was very friendly, and it was walking distance from Union Square.  Check in was smooth.  The room was large and clean.  We went to San Francisco for a girlfriends weekend getaway.  Half of the group stayed at a timeshare in Union Square.  We chose the Adagio instead.  For the money, we got a good deal.  Room big enough for 3 ladies and we didn't feel crowded.  The lobby staff always made you feel welcomed whether you were coming or going.  They were also very helpful if you had questions, or wanted restaurant recommendations.

4 stars
Highlights:
* Very friendly and helpful staff
* Very clean rooms & bathrooms
* Just a few blocks from Union Square
* Walking distance from amazing restaurants
* Happy Hour was quaint and fun

Could use improvement:
* Water Pressure was almost nonexistent (but they are in a drought so couldn't be too upset)
* Issues with payment and double charges
* Room service, coffee and the like are extra services that you must pay for apart from your room

3 stars
Located just a few blocks from Union Square, this cute boutique hotel is all around good.

We stayed at the Palace beginning of July and had a wonderful stay. I can't say enough about how friendly and helpful the staff are there. Housekeepers, bellman, concierge and front desk staff are were marvellous. The room was beautiful, small but perfectly appointed and decorated with an extremely modern bathroom.

5 stars
Hotels don't get any prettier than the Palace. The lounge/lobby is as luxurious and beautiful as you will ever see. The rooms are nice and quiet. A great luxury experience.

3 stars
Ok, so it's a beautiful landmark hotel with stunning ceiling in the lobby. The room was fairly standard though the bathroom was stylish. However, why on earth would a luxury hotel not have wi fi freely available throughout.

2 stars
The Palace calls itself a "luxury collection" hotel. It all depends on what you mean by luxury. If you mean going through the motions of (mediocrely) carpeted halls, low-grade silver cutlery, and liveried personnel, you got it.

Over-all it's a great value.  Prime location: walking distance to Times Square, public transportation, deli's, etc.  The staff is excellent!  If you have an issue they will take care of it.  The adjoining night club make it very difficult to actually sleep before two am.  But it's NY so we took that with a grain of salt.  

3 stars
The rooms are very modern and the bathrooms look like they have been renovated. There are no bathtubs (or at least not the room we stayed in) but the shower is nice and roomy. Located in Hell's Kitchen, it's close enough to Times Square, but far enough from the huge, annoying crowds. There are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby on 9th Avenue. So if you're looking to explore NYC, the Out is a good option.

4 stars
I was impressed with the room as well.  Considering where you are, these are really well designed rooms.  Considering the price point, they are large for the price.  The bed was excellent - and I am a raving insomniac. We had plenty of room, and the bathroom was excellent.

5 stars
Cool hotel!  Very spacious rooms; well decorated; beautiful bathroom/shower; VERY comfortable bed!  Plus, a very cool lobby with a lounge/waiting room.  There's also a nice restaurant attached to it as well.  And the staff here are very friendly and courteous.  I will definitely stay here again!

The Yotel is a very futuristic hotel a short walk from Times Square/Broadway/Hells Kitchen so a ideal location for a short city break in NYC. The rooms are small but the space is utilized efficiently so the rooms do not feel cramped, for the time you spend in the hotel room in NYC the rooms are more than adequate.

5 stars
This was my second stay here, and even more enjoyable than the first because I knew where everything was located in the room. The location was near the Javits Convention Center where I was attending a meeting. The room was spotless and larger than I remember.

4 stars
Who comes to NYC and spends all their time in the hotel room? If that's you then get a life! This place is in a great location and offers a basic yet clean/comfy place to hang your hat while in Hells Kitchen. I'd recommend it as most places are way overpriced in Manhattan. Friendly Staff and would come back again!

5 stars
Their rooms are so efficient and modern...small, but it didn't matter due to the top notch luxuries in the room. I particularly loved the lights around the tv, and the shower! OMG. The shower was beautifully designed glass with an amazing shower head. This is the perfect room for one or two nights. Very cool and futuristic!!!
